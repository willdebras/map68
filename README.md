This is a quick project to plot lovable hand-drawn esque election maps
to the style of the New York Timesâ€™ 1968 election map:

Inspired by [this
tweet](https://twitter.com/alv9n/status/1319013784346906629) showing
interest in the simple, yet elegant polygons created for this map, I
decideed to trace the map as an svg and georeference to a geojson file,
so someone could easily plot this map with fill based on vote count or
other data.

The map is available as an svg in this repo with path ids defined as the
state postal code:

![svg of 1968 NYT election map](elections_fill.svg)

It is also available as a plottable geojson file.

Simply read in the file, tidy it, and plot it with geom\_polygon.

``` r

library(geojsonio)
#> Warning: package 'geojsonio' was built under R version 4.0.3
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'geojsonio'

spdf <- geojsonio::geojson_read("./elections_features.geojson",  what = "sp")


spdf_fortified <- broom::tidy(spdf) %>% dplyr::filter(!id==1)
#> Regions defined for each Polygons

library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = spdf_fortified, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, colour = "#00abff") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_map()
```

The plan is to set each polygon to have the state postal code to be
easily bound to election data before the 2020 presidential election.

Feel free to clone or fork the repo if you would like to use the files
